# react-native-popout example

Example app for the library.
Three examples are available;

- Netflix: a basic remake of the Netflix app transitions
- AppStore: a basic remake of the iOS App store transitions
- Minimal: a minimal example, just what you need to get started using this library
- Testing: various different shapes and overlays
- Springboard: a basic remake of the iOS Springboard transitions (TODO)

You can swap between the examples by changing the `App.tsx` file.
